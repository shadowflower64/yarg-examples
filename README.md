# YARG Examples

This repository contains various test files and example files for [*Yet Another Rhythm Game*](https://yarg.in/). You can use these files to test out various aspects of the game. Currently, this repository contains chart files, camera preset files, and REAPER files for charting. In the future the repo may also include other types of files, such as replays, or other types of presets.

The purpose of these files is for anyone to be able to easily test out features of YARG, such as various play modes (5-Fret Guitar, 5-Lane Keys, Vocals, Pro Keys, Pro Guitar, Elite Drums etc.), venue lighting, post-processing effects, camera cuts, engine features such as infinite frontend and other aspects of the game. These files can also be used for reproducing unusual behavior, and for bug reports, as they contain no copyrighted audio. 

## Contributing

If you want to contribute your own chart to this repo, make a [pull request](https://github.com/shadowflower64/yarg-examples/pulls) and I will review your changes. I may adapt your chart to the correct format if necessary. If you wish to request any example chart ideas, you can create an issue, and some day it may be added to the repo.
